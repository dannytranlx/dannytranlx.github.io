##Hello!

My name is Danny, I am currently completing my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology at [&Eacute;cole de technologie sup&eacute;rieure](http://etsmtl.ca/) in Montr&eacute;al, Canada.

I love coding pixel-perfect web applications and working on various multimedia productions. I am always looking to learn the best and the most efficient way [to do my projects](projects). On my multiple internships, I have worked with [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) and [Ext JS](http://sencha.com/) as a front-end framework on various back-end technologies (.NET with C#, PHP and Java).

When I actually leave my laptop, I love to drink a beer in front of a hockey game or take [pictures with my camera](http://www.flickr.com/dannytranlx). I also get a lot involved in [several](http://clubapplets.ca/) [student](http://lanets.ca/) [societies](http://dciets.com/) by helping them with their websites or creating promotional materials.

Let's talk! Tweet me [@dannytranlx](http://twitter.com/dannytranlx) or send me an email [danny@dannytran.ca](mailto:danny@dannytran.ca) :)
