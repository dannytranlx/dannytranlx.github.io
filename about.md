## Hello!

My name is Danny, I've completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology at [&Eacute;cole de technologie sup&eacute;rieure](http://etsmtl.ca/) and am now part of the team developing [Smooch](https://smooch.io/?ref=dt) in the beautiful city of Montr&eacute;al.

I love coding pixel-perfect web applications and working on various multimedia productions. I am always looking to learn the best and the most efficient way [to do my projects](projects). From my projects, I've now gather experience with Backbone, Marionette, Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.

When I actually leave my laptop, I love to drink a beer in front of a hockey game or take [pictures with my camera](http://www.flickr.com/dannytranlx). I also get a lot involved in [several](http://clubapplets.ca/) [student](http://lanets.ca/) [societies](http://dciets.com/) by helping them with their websites or creating promotional materials.

Let's talk! Feel free to tweet me @dannytranlx :bowtie:
