##Projects

Here are some projects I worked on :

### [D&eacute;l&eacute;gation des comp&eacute;titions en informatique de l'&Eacute;TS](http://dciets.com/)

I've built this website with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/). On this project, I tried out the [HAML](http://haml.info) syntax to produce HTML layouts, but we later replace it with regular HTML since GitHub Pages doesn't support HAML. The project is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/dciets/dciets.github.io) and is regularly updated via Git.

### [Bookies](http://dtrn.co/bookies-web/app)

I've built this web application with [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/) to fetch data from an API. For that project, I have also set up a personal [Ubuntu server](http://dtrn.co/) with Apache to host the web application and the [Symfony backend](https://github.com/fpoirier1/bookies-app).

### [dannytranlx.github.io](http://dannytran.ca)

This project is my personal static website with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/). The project is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/dannytranlx/dannytranlx.github.io). The fonts used are [Lato](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato) and [Open Sans](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) and social icons are from the [Somacro set](http://veodesign.com/2011/en/11/08/somacro-27-free-big-and-simple-social-media-icons/) by [veodesign](http://veodesign.com/).
