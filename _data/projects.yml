  url: http://bixi-api.herokuapp.com/
  description: I wrote this project with Python and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) to scrape the [Bixi website](http://montreal.bixi.com) in order to get the dock status with the number of available bikes and docks. This will be used in a [Pebble app](https://developer.getpebble.com/) project I want to do to locate Bixi docks with their status on my Pebble watch.

  description: In the summer of 2013, the city of Montreal started a pilot project to allow back food trucks in the city. One of the spot was right in front of my college. I wrote a Python script to scrape the schedule and target what food trucks is going to be available for lunch and tweet it on the [@etsbouffe handle](https://twitter.com/etsbouffe).

  description: I've built this website with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com/). On this project, I tried out the [HAML](http://haml.info) syntax to produce HTML layouts, but we later replace it with regular HTML since GitHub Pages doesn't support HAML. The project is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/dciets/dciets.github.io) and is regularly updated via Git.
